# AI Usage Summary

## Tools Used
- **ChatGPT** – Used for code reviews, debugging help, and small improvements.
- **GitHub Copilot** – Used for writing some README sections and small code suggestions.

## How AI Was Used

### Component & Hook Decisions
I asked ChatGPT whether I should create a hook or a separate Icon component.  
AI reviewed my code and helped me choose a cleaner structure.

### Character Counter Optimization
AI guided me on how to properly calculate and display the remaining characters in a TextInput.


### UI & Lookup Table Improvements
I asked for suggestions about:
- improving the StatusChip design  
- using a lookup table approach  
- adding gradient background ideas for specific states  

### Firebase/Firestore Setup Errors
AI helped interpret errors such as:
- Firestore not enabled  
- Database not created  
- Missing permissions  
- Authentication required (`firebase login`)  
- Understanding HTTP 422 errors  

### README Help
Some small README sections were written with Copilot suggestions.

## Lastly 
AI tools helped speed up debugging, gave UI/UX suggestions, and improved code structure.
However, I still reviewed and implemented the final code manually. 
I didn’t use AI for the final version of the code. If I wasn’t sure about something, I asked for step-by-step example code and explanations.
